# TaskBreaker App Redesign

## Core Concept: AI Coaching for ADHD Users

The redesigned app will focus on conversation-based goal setting and task management, specifically tailored for users with ADHD. The AI coach will take a much more proactive role in helping users define, break down, and complete tasks.

## Key Features

1. **Conversational AI Coach Interface**
   - Replace form-based goal creation with a chat interface
   - The coach talks users through goal definition and refinement
   - Empathetic communication style with ADHD-specific support strategies

2. **Dynamic Task Generation**
   - AI creates tasks and subtasks based on conversation
   - Users can approve, modify, or request alternatives
   - Visual representation of task breakdown with time estimates

3. **Proactive Communication System**
   - Intelligent notifications based on user behavior patterns
   - Multi-channel reminders (app, email, WhatsApp) with frequency options
   - Motivational messages that acknowledge ADHD challenges

4. **Focus-Optimized UI**
   - Clean, distraction-free interface with reduced visual clutter
   - Single-task focus mode to limit overwhelm
   - Visually engaging progress tracking with dopamine-triggering rewards

5. **Accountability Features**
   - Check-ins initiated by the AI coach
   - Celebration of small wins and milestones
   - Roadblock identification and resolution through conversation

## User Experience Flow
